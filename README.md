This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript type error: Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'. The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, where an array of strings is passed to a function expecting a single string. The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a corrected version.  The error highlights the importance of type checking in TypeScript and demonstrates different approaches to handling arrays of strings in function parameters.
